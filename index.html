          diagnostic value, but we also invented new materials for their own sake. My
          group published over 40 papers in peer-reviewed journals, and 10 Ph.D. students completed their doctoral
          research theses in the group.</p>

            undergraduate research with Prof. Ken Wiberg. I also worked in a contract DNA synthesis lab at Yale Medical

        <p class="main-standalone">Frankly, I wasn't a great professor. Professors at research-intensive
          institutions like the University
          of Minnesota succeed
          on the strength of their research. But I struggled to build a research program that was anywhere as
          innovative or
          impactful as the ones I had worked in as a graduate student or postdoc. After the rush of earning tenure, I
          came to hate writing grant
          applications, not just because professors have to do it so much, but also because I lacked faith in the ideas
          I wrote about. I was also <a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1062308">a pretty
            undistingished teacher</a>. I got better with time and training, but my giant
          undergraduate organic chemistry courses came to feel more
          like taskwork than education.</p>
        <p class="main-standalone">In 2012, I spoke with my department head about winding down my research group, and
          potentially leaving my job. He drew up a "memorandum of understanding" that modified my annual post-tenure
          review while I shrank my lab. In 2014, one of my last remaining students was involved in a lab accident
          that sent him to the hospital (with injuries he thankfully recovered from fully). It wasn't my fault, but I
          certainly felt responsible, and it cemented my decision to leave.</p>
        <p class="main-standalone">I have always enjoyed working with computers. I was my group's network admin as a
          postdoc and as a professor, and I got to do some web and instrument automation programming in both of those
          positions as well. And, of course, I am amazed by programming's breathtaking potential. In my last year at
          the university, I decided to do some self-study, and then to apply to
          Prime Academy in Minneapolis. I was already enrolled at Prime when I left my position at the U of M.</p>
